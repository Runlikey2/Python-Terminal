# Python-Terminal

This is a personal project for fun none of this code is high quality or up to standard but can be used as an Example for something.
You can make your own commands using the templates which will be uploaded shortly but for now you can look through and create your own if you want to.

An editor for python files is being worked on will also be added to this repository shortly.
