# Python-Terminal (WIP)
A fun Python terminal emulator with easy command extensibility

This is a personal project I'm building for fun. It's definitely a work in progress and not meant for anything beyond an example to base your own off of, but feel free to poke around the code.

💡 What is this?

A simple, text-based terminal interface written in Python. I wanted to see if I could make a system where adding new commands is as easy as dropping in a new file.

🛠️ How to try it

```
Download the files.

Open your terminal/command prompt in the project folder.

Run python main.py.
```

📂 Current Status

```
Commands: Basic logic is in. I'll be uploading templates soon so you can add your own.

Editor: I'm currently working on a built-in Python file editor.

Dependencies: None! Just standard Python for now.

Operating System: Windows only as I didn't think of releasing it.

Security: Needs redoing to make it secure might remove if it's too much.

Logon: Adding support for adding users and passwords with permissions in the near future.
```
