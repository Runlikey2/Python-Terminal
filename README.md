Python-Terminal (WIP)

This is a personal project I’m building for fun. It’s definitely a work in progress and not meant for anything beyond a example to base your own off of use, but feel free to poke around the code.
💡 What is this?

A simple, text-based terminal interface written in Python. I wanted to see if I could make a system where adding new commands is as easy as dropping in a new file.
🛠️ How to try it

    Download the files.

    Open your terminal/command prompt in the project folder.

    Run python main.py.

📂 Current Status

    Commands: Basic logic is in. I'll be uploading templates soon so you can add your own.

    Editor: I'm currently working on a built-in Python file editor.

    Dependencies: None! Just standard Python for now.
